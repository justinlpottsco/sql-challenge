# sql-challenge

Created my ERD file first to make sure I had the correct flow between tables. This enabled me to be able to see which variables aka columns 
should be Keys.

With the ERD file it was fairly easy, which is unordinary for me in programming thus far, to be able to Select the tables -> columns necessary to Join together
in order to list out the information called for.
